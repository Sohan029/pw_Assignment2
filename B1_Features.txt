HTML Features:

1.Semantics: HTML5 introduced new elements with semantic meaning, such as <header>, 
  <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, etc. These elements provide a clearer structure and meaning to the content of a web page.


2.Multimedia Support: HTML5 includes native support for embedding and playing audio and video content without the need for 
  third-party plugins like Flash.

3.Canvas: The <canvas> element in HTML5 provides a powerful and flexible way to draw graphics and animations directly on a
   web page using JavaScript.

4.Geolocation: HTML5 provides an API that allows websites to access the user's geographical location information. 
  This feature enables location-based services, mapping applications, and other location-aware web applications.

5.Drag and Drop: HTML5 added support for native drag and drop functionality, making it easier to implement intuitive
  user interfaces that involve dragging and dropping elements.
